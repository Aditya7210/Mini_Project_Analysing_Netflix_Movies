# Mini_Projects
In this project I utilise my understanding of Python Loops, Comparison Operators, Matplotlib, DataFrames to analyse Secondary Data provided by DataCamp.

Exploratory Data Analyis is conducted for a production company to uncover insights on Netflix Movie data from a perticular decade.

The Following Questions will be answered in this project

1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? (1990-2000).
2. A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes long. What is the total number of short action movies released in the 1990s (1990-2000)

This project utilises For Loops, Matplotlib and Filtering DataFrame to answer the above questions.

#CONTEXT 

**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

You work for a production company that specializes in nostalgic styles. You want to do some research on movies released in the 1990's. You'll delve into Netflix data and perform exploratory data analysis to better understand this awesome movie decade!

You have been supplied with the dataset `netflix_data.csv`, along with the following table detailing the column names and descriptions. Feel free to experiment further after submitting!
