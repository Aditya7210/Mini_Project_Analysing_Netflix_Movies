# Mini_Projects
In this project I utilise my understanding of Python Loops, Comparison Operators, Matplotlib, DataFrames to analyse Secondary Data provided by DataCamp.

Exploratory Data Analyis is conducted for a production company to uncover insights on Netflix Movie data from a perticular decade.

The Following Questions will be answered in this project

1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? (1990-2000).
2. A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes long. What is the total number of short action movies released in the 1990s (1990-2000)

This project utilises For Loops, Matplotlib and Filtering DataFrame to answer the above questions.
